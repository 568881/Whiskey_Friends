Yeah, I'm always down for two beers
That ain't nothing new here
It's usually what I do here, but not tonight
Yeah, we had a bad one
Way worse than the last one
Ain't no comin' back from this goodbye 

Looks like I did it again
Me and my stupid mouth
I dug myself into a hole in the wall
And I gotta drink my way out
